Barebones Message Board created using Rails 6.1, Ruby 2.6.9, Devise 4.8.1, and Bootstrap 5.

This application requires you to create an account with a name, email, and password as well as login with your 
credentials before accessing the message board.

The home page displays a listing of all the postings and the ability to create a posting. For each posting on the home 
page, there is a link to show more info on a details page. If you are the author of that posting, you will be shown links
 to edit and delete your posting.

Visting a posting page will give you the posts details, but also show all the comments and gives you the ability to add
 a comment. If you are the author of that comment, you will be shown links to edit and delete your comment.
 
Lastly, you will not be allowed to edit other authors postings and comments.
